These notes could be stored in `.json` sidecars next to the files. For example, the key `KirstieInspected` could include free text notes on whether I've inspected the files.\r\n\r\nThis functionality probably shouldn't be incorporated into the [BIDS specification](http:\/\/bids.neuroimaging.io\/bids_spec.pdf) - or if it does it should be a BIDS specific discussion (and the key should definitely not be called `KirstieInspected` \ud83e\udd23) rather than something that pybids implements without discussion\r\n\r\n**However** there is quite a nice flag that could be added to pybids (suggested by @tyarkoni) to add a flag to the `df = layout.as_data_frame()` command to add *all metadata* stored in the `.json` files to that dataframe.\r\n\r\nIt would be off by default, but example usage would be `layout.as_data_frame(all_metadata=True)` and it would add a column for **every metadata key** that appears in the whole layout. `KirstieInspected` which would contain NaNs if the key wasn't in a sidecar file, or contain the free text notes if it did, and this would be the same behaviour for [other keys](http:\/\/bids.neuroimaging.io\/bids_spec.pdf#h.5u721tt1h9pe) (`RepetitionTime`, `EchoTime`, `Manufacturer` etc).\r\n\r\nI've had a quick look through the code and I can't find this particular command (sorry!) so I'm not a great person to make a start. But happy to clarify the goal if needed, and can take instruction if that's helpful \u2728 ","1":"This PR creates a module to check whether the files within a BIDS data set match the user's expectations.
